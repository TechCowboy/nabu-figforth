                       8080 fig-FORTH Release 1.1


#BUF         ---  n
         A constant returning the number of disk buffers allocated.  For
         the disk I-O routines to work correctly #BUF must be greater than 1.

.CPU
         Prints the processor name (i.e.8080) from ORIG+22H encoded as a 
         32 bit, base 36 integer.
        
2!           nlow  nhigh  addr  ---
         32 bit store.  nhigh is stored at addr; nlow is stored at addr+2.
        
2@           addr  ---  nlow  nhigh
         32 bit fetch.  nhigh is fetched from addr;  nlow is fetched from
         addr+2.
        
2DUP         n2  n1  ---  n2  n1  n2  n1
         Duplicates the top two values on the stack.  Equivalent to OVER OVER.
        
C/L          ---  n
         Constant leaving the number of characters per line; used by the
         editor.
        
DENSITY      ---  addr
         A variable used by the disk interface.
         0 = single density;  1 = double density.
        
DISK-ERROR   ---  addr
         A variable used by the disk interface, containing the disk status
         for the last sector read or written.  0 means no error.
          
DRIVE        ---  addr
         A variable used by disk interface, containing the disk drive
         number (0 to MXDRV) used on the last sector read or written.
         
FLUSH         
         Write all UPDATEd disk buffers to disk.  Should be used after
         editing, before dismounting a disk, or before exiting FORTH.
         
NOOP         
         A Forth ‘no operation’.
         
P!           b  port#  ---
         8080 or Z-80 I-0 port store.  Outputs byte b to port#.

P@           port#  ---  b
         8080 or Z-80 I-O port fetch.  Inputs byte b from port#.
         
RP@          ---  addr
         Leaves the current value in the return stack pointer register.
         
SEC          ---  addr
         A variable used by the disk interface, containing the sector number
         last read or written relative to the last drive used.

SEC-READ
         Reads a disc sector (BPS bytes) into memory.  All parameters must
         have been set by SET-DRIVE and SET-I0.  The status on completion
         is stored in DISK-ERROR.
         
SEC-WRITE
         Writes a disk-sector (BPS bytes) from memory.  All parameters must
         have been set by SET-DRIVE and SET-I0.  The status on completion
         is stored in DISK-ERROR.
         
SET-DRIVE
         A CP/M service call which makes subsequent disk reads and writes use
         
         the drive designated in DRIVE.  T&SCALC is usually used to set
         DRIVE and call SET-DRIVE.  0 = first drive to MXDRV
         
SET-I0
         A CP/M service call which makes subsequent disc reads and writes
         use the drive last set by SET-DRIVE, the memory address in variable
         USE, the sector number in SEC, and the track number in TRACK.
         T&SCALC  is usually used to set these variables.
         
T&SCALC      n  ---
         Track & Sector and drive calculation for disk I0.  n is the
         total sector dispacement from the first logical drive to the
         desired sector.
                n  =  (block# + OFFSET) * SEC/BLK
         The corresponding drive, track, and sector numbers are calculated.
         If the drive number is different from the contents of DRIVE, the new
         drive number is stored in DRIVE and SET-DRIVE is executed.
         
         The track number is stored in TRACK; the sector number is stored
         in SEC.  T&SCALC is usually executed before SET-DRIVE.
         
TRACK        ---  addr
         A variable used by disk I-O.  Contains the track number last
         read or written relative to the current drive.
         
U<           u1  u2  ---  f
         Leave the boolean value of an unsigned less-than comparison.  Leaves
         f = 1 for  ul < u2; otherwise leaves 0.  This function must be
         used when comparing memory addresses.  u1 and u2 are unsigned
         16 bit integers.
